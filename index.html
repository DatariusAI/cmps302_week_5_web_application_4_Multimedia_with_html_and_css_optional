<p> The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe. 
It stretches across eight Alpine countries:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Austria</dt>
<dd>Officially the Republic of Austria in Central Europe - Capital: Vienna.</dd>
<dt>France</dt>
<dd>Officially the French Republic in Western Europe - Capital: Paris.</dd>
<dt>Germany</dt>
<dd>Officially the Federal Republic of Germany in Central-Western Europe - Capital: Berlin</dd>
<dt>Italy</dt>
<dd>Officially the Italian Republic, and ofter referred to as Lo Stivale (the Boot) - Capital: Rome</dd>
<dt>Liechtenstein</dt>
<dd>Officially the Principality of Liechtenstein in Central Europe - Capital: Vaduz</dd>
<dt>Monaco</dt>
<dd>Officially the Principality of Monaco in Western Europe - Capital: Monaco</dd>
<dt>Slovenia</dt>
<dd>Officially the Republic of Slovenia in Southern Central Europe - Capital: Ljubljana</dd>
<dt>Switzerland</dt>
<dd>Offically the Swiss Confederation in Western-Central Europe - Capital: Bern</dd>
</dl>


<p>
Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. 
The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4000 meters.</p>

<h2>Geography</h2>
<img class = "floatLeft" src="Pictures/Map.jpg">

<p>The Alps are a crescent shaped geographic feature of central Europe that ranges in a 800 km (500 mi) arc from east to west and is 200 km (120 mi) in width. 
The mean height of the mountain peaks is 2.5 km (1.6 mi). The range stretches from the Mediterranean Sea north above the Po basin, extending through France from Grenoble, and stretching eastward through mid and southern Switzerland. The range continues onward toward Vienna, Austria, and east to the Adriatic Sea and Slovenia. 
To the south it dips into northern Italy and to the north extends to the southern border of Bavaria in Germany. In areas like Chiasso, Switzerland, and Allgäu, Bavaria, the demarcation between the mountain range and the flatlands are clear; in other places such as Geneva, the demarcation is less clear. </p>
<p>The countries with the greatest alpine territory are Switzerland, France, Austria and Italy.
The highest portion of the range is divided by the glacial trough of the Rhone valley, with the Pennine Alps from Mont Blanc to the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa on the southern side, and the Bernese Alps on the northern. The peaks in the easterly portion of the range, in Austria and Slovenia, are smaller than those in the central and western portions.</p>

<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Flora</h3>
<p>Thirteen thousand species of plants have been identified in the Alpine regions. Alpine plants are grouped by habitat and soil type which can be limestone or non-calcareous. 
The habitats range from meadows, bogs, woodland (deciduous and coniferous) areas to soil-less scree and moraines, and rock faces and ridges. A natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief deciduous trees—oak, beech, ash and sycamore maple. </p>
<p>The extreme and stressful climatic conditions give way to the growth of plant species with secondary metabolites important for medicinal purposes. Origanum vulgare, Prunella vulgaris, Solanum nigrum and Urtica dioica are some of the more useful medicinal species found in the Alps.</p>
<h3>Fauna</h3>

</figure> 
<p>The Alps are a habitat for 30,000 species of wildlife, ranging from the tiniest snow fleas to brown bears, many of which have made adaptations to the harsh cold conditions and high altitudes to the point that some only survive in specific micro-climates either directly above or below the snow line.</p>
<p>The largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex, which have been sighted as high as 3,000 m (9,843 ft). The ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses. Alps are still home to brown bears. </p>
<p>Many rodents such as voles live underground. Marmots live almost exclusively above the tree line as high as 2,700 m (8,858 ft). They hibernate in large groups to provide warmth, and can be found in all areas of the Alps, in large colonies they build beneath the alpine pastures.</p>
<p>Golden eagles and bearded vultures are the largest birds to be found in the Alps; they nest high on rocky ledges and can be found at altitudes of 2,400 m (7,874 ft).</p>

<h2>"Four-Thousanders"</h2>

<p>The Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA) has defined a list of 82 "official" Alpine summits that reach at least 4,000 m (13,123 ft). 
The list includes not only mountains, but also subpeaks with little prominence that are considered important mountaineering objectives.
<br>Below are listed the 11 "four-thousanders" with at least 500 m (1,640 ft) of prominence: </p>

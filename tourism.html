			<h2>Tourism</h2>
			<p>The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps, travelled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery, and stayed at the spa-resorts. 
			Large hotels were built during the Belle Epoque; cog-railways, built early in the 20th century, brought tourists to ever higher elevations, with the Jungfraubahn terminating at the 
			Jungfraujoch, well above the eternal snow-line, after going through a tunnel in Eiger.
			<br>
			The Alps are one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world with many resorts such as:</p>

			<h3>Winter Sports</h3>
			<p>In the early 19th and 20th century, winter sports were slowly introduced: In 1882 the first figure skating championship was held in St. Moritz, and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century, as the first 
			ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald.<br>In the first half of the 20th century the Olympic Winter Games were held three times in Alpine venues:</p>
			
			<ol type="I">
				<li>The 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France;</li>
				<li>The 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland;</li>
				<li>The 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>During World War II the winter games were cancelled but after that time the Winter Games have been held in St. Moritz (1948), Cortina d'Ampezzo (1956), Innsbruck, Austria 
			(1964 and 1976), Grenoble, France, (1968), Albertville, France, (1992), and Torino (2006).
			In 1930 the Lauberhorn Rennen (Lauberhorn Race), was run for the first time on the Lauberhorn above Wengen; the equally demanding Hahnenkamm was first run in the same year in 
			Kitzbühl, Austria. Both races continue to be held each January on successive weekends. The Lauberhorn is the more strenuous downhill race at 4.5 km (2.8 mi) and poses danger to 
			racers who reach 130 km/h (81 mph) within seconds of leaving the start gate.</p>
			
			<h2>Passes</h2>
			<p>The Alps have been crossed for war and commerce, and by pilgrims, students and tourists. Crossing routes by road, train or foot are known as passes, and usually consist of 
			depressions in the mountains in which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre-mountainous zones. 
			In the medieval period hospices were established by religious orders at the summits of many of the main passes. The most important passes are:</p>
			
			<ul> 
				<li>Col de l'Iseran (the highest)</li>
				<li>Brenner Pass</li>
				<li>Mont-Cenis</li>
				<li>Great St. Bernard Pass</li>
				<li>Col de Tende</li>
				<li>Gotthard Pass</li>
				<li>Semmering Pass</li>
				<li>Simplon Pass</li>
				<li>Stelvio Pass</li>
			</ul>
